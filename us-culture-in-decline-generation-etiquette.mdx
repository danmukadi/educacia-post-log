We can only go so far if we continue on the path we’re on...  

Mass lawlessness, declining mental health, breakdown of community, 
rampant acts of narcissism, and fame chasing. The collective social behavior of the US has strayed away and beyond from our ancestors’. 
And this has been allowed to seep deeper into the minds of our next few generations, so much so that many have sedated into a listless slumber. 
As community ties have crumbled, there have come a generation of boys who’ve been taught to mind their own business when chaos roams, 
girls who have been painted a picture of inherent victimhood from feminist retellings of history. Further, social media has instructed 
them to hate themselves, envy others, and scorn nayssayers. It’s only through this path that down the line, you come to the expected 
conclusions of a society that places itself over everything break.  

The future surely looks like a scene straight out of Gotham.
Fear-mongering aside, why have things broken down to this reality? 
For as much credit as radical government laws, social media and community-loss deserve, I think another problem has to be addressed. 
The core problem being a lack of guidance in life.
