We can only go so far if we continue on the path we’re on...
<br />

Mass lawlessness, declining mental health, breakdown of community, 
rampant acts of narcissism, and fame chasing. The collective social behavior of the US has strayed away and beyond from our ancestors’. 

<br />

And this has been allowed to seep deeper into the minds of our next few generations, so much so that many have sedated into a listless slumber. 
As community ties have crumbled, there have come a generation of boys who’ve been taught to mind their own business when chaos roams, 
girls who have been painted a picture of inherent victimhood from feminist retellings of history. Further, social media has instructed 
them to hate themselves, envy others, and scorn nayssayers. 

<br />

It’s only through this path that down the line, you come to the expected 
conclusions of a society that places itself over everything break.  

<br />

The future surely looks like a scene straight out of Gotham.
Fear-mongering aside, why have things broken down to this reality? 
For as much credit as radical government laws, social media and community-loss deserve, 
I think another problem has to be addressed. 
The core problem being a lack of guidance in life.

<br />

Look around today. It’s commonly said that kids lack direction, and young as they are they are hungry for it. 
They want people to look up to, to aspire to become etc. While to some degree they will be held to the task 
of taking care of things on their own, they need strong leadership and guidance into the awkward, the confusing 
and the excitement of interactions with their peers. 

<br />

Why else do you find kids imitating celebrities, internet moguls and local legends? 
They are looking for heroes…they are looking for something to chase after and imitate in order to form 
their identity whether they know it or not. 

<br />

Unfortunately, for parents, many of these role models are not suited for the task. 
The same models that have a complete disregard for social norms, and etiquette have invaded the 
minds of your children and twisted their intentions. 
False heroes that continue to lead your child down a path of degeneracy and unresolved pain. 

<br />

En masse, this has created a sweeping movement that has changed culture. 
These kids become future leaders and take those influences into the public, into their careers, 
into their relationships, into their future families, etc. 

<br />

We as Americans have lost something from us that once made life fun, exciting and connective. 
Deep conversations with strangers, groups that would look out for you out of sheer kindness, 
a social identity that would encourage the youth to become leaders for their local communities 
as well as leaders for the greater good. 

<br />

I believe in part, it’s this loss of etiquette and social rules that steers kids towards social 
and self confusion. The great underlying question that many kids face: How do I fit into society? 
Where do I fit? How can I be of use to others? 

<br />

These questions are the ones that persist early in life and the better of an answer we have, we achieve a things: 

<br />

<ol>
    <li>We get more out of life knowing we have a community we are a part of outside of family.</li>
    <li>We inspire kids to be leaders, to look out for their neighbors </li>
    <li>Kids achieve a stronger sense of identity not only within themselves but alongside others (strangers and friends alike)</li>
</ol>
